Z, a god of death, educates her in the ways of the world, in combat, and in the long-forgotten arts of magic—right up until the day Z disappears. Olivia leaves the forest for the first time in search of Z with its ebony blade in hand. Out in the wider world, all is not well. A bitter war rages between the Asvelt Empire and the Kingdom of Fernest, and Fernest is losing badly. When Olivia shows up on Fernest’s doorstep with a sack of imperial heads looking to volunteer, the royal army happily welcomes her into its ranks. Thanks to Z’s training, she quickly proves herself as a ferocious warrior. In fact, she might be just what Fernest needs to turn the tide of the war...but will they accept her lack of people skills and disregard for discipline? And will she ever see Z again?"

Like only chasing to have the engagement cancelled in the Magic Academy, even breaking and taking over the Duke’s house. For all these eventful stuff, please just give me a break! Or should I say the heart of the game’s heroine is too scarily impregnable! Living differently with the game’s knowledge? Dating the love interests in real life is super troublesome, so I refuse!"
